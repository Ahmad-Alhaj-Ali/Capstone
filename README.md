Project Overview
This project is a database design for managing a single restaurant.
The system handles the essential operations of the restaurant, such as managing menu items, orders, deliveries, payments, and customer interactions.

What I Did
Designed the ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) for the restaurant system.

Built database tables for:

Users (Admin, Customers, Delivery Persons)

Menu Items and Categories

Orders and Order Items

Payments and Discounts

Order Tracking

Ratings and Reviews

Notifications, Chat, Favorites, and Cart

Defined relationships between all entities to maintain data consistency.

Included timestamps for tracking creation and updates of records.
